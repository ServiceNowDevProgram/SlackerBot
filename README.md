## Two ways to contribute

[Easy](#easy-method-adding-new-parser) or [Hard](#regular-method-adding-new-functionality-types)

### Easy method (Adding new parser)

Can be done without pulling this app into a ServiceNow instance

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new branch (name it according to what functionality you are adding)
3. Create a new .js file in the [Parsers](Parsers) folder (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for requirements)
4. Submit a pull request to the ServiceNowDevProgram/SlackerBot `main` branch

If approved, your new parser automatically goes live for the bot's immediate use!

### Regular method (Adding new functionality types)

1. Fork this repo
2. Go to your ServiceNow instance
3. Go to `System Applications` => `Studio`
4. Once Studio loads, select `Import From Source Control`
5. Use your forked repo to [Import your application](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/quebec/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_devenvironment_quebec_importing_an_application_from_source_control)
6. Optional: See below on how to get this bot working on your own slack server
7. Make updates to the application (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details)
8. In Studio, commit your changes to source control
9. Submit a pull request to the ServiceNowDevProgram/SlackerBot `main` branch

An accepted Pull Request and merge does not necessarily mean the functionality will go live immediately, as an admin for the host instance will need to pull the application into ServiceNow.

## Installing this bot on your own Slack server

### Create Slack App, Install into Slack

* Create new Slack app (in an instance where you are an admin, not in SNDevs) (https://api.slack.com/apps/new)
* Enable events
* Request URL =  https://YOURDEVINSTANCE.service-now.com/api/x_snc_slackerbot/slackerbot_event_handler
* Subscribe to Workspace Events (message.channels, message.groups)
* Add a bot user
* Give bot permissions to post messages (chat:write:bot)
* Make a note of the "Bot User OAuth Access Token" (for ServiceNow sys_properties later on)
* Install app into your Slack channel

### Connect them together

* Place token into the ServiceNow system property 'x_snc_slackerbot.SlackerBot.token' 
  * REMINDER: When you commit your changes, always delete the value of this property before you commit. If you forget to do this, Slack will automatically disable your token when it does a scan of GitHub and sees that you accidentally placed your private token online. If this happens, go into your Slack app and issue a new token.

### Testing

* Invite your bot to a Slack channel
* Create a parser on the `x_snc_slackerbot_parser` table
* Activate the parser in the Slack channel

### Troubleshooting

* Check the Payload `x_snc_slackerbot_payload` table to make sure SN is receiving Slack messages
* Check 'Outbound HTTP Requests' to make sure the bot is replying to the channel

## Auto populate your Parsers table

To fill your Parsers `x_snc_slackerbot_parser` table with all the parsers that exist on this repo:

* Go to the Parsers table list (type `x_snc_slackerbot_parser.list` in your filter navigator and press enter)
* Click on the "Sync Parsers" Banner UI Action

This syncs your table to *this* repo, if you rather sync it to another repo, change the value of your `x_snc_slackerbot.Parsers_Sync_Repo` system property.

## Setting up the GitHub to ServiceNow integration

The Parsers folder on [ServiceNowDevProgram/SlackerBot](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/SlackerBot/) is set up to send changes to the ServiceNow instance that @Slacker is hosted on (automatically, on every commit). To do this for your own fork and ServiceNow instance:

* In your forked repository, click on the Actions tab
* Click on "I understand" to activate workflows
* Go to the Settings tab
* Under `Secrets` and `Actions` add the following repository secrets:
  * `SN_INSTANCE_NAME` your ServiceNow instance name
  * `ADMIN_USERNAME` the username of an admin account on your ServiceNow instance
  * `ADMIN_PASSWORD` the password of the above account
  
### Testing

* Create a new file in the Parsers folder and name it `something.js`
* Follow the template in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document
* Commit the file
* Check your ServiceNow instance on the Parsers `x_snc_slackerbot_parser` table and verify the file was uploaded
* Trigger the parser on a slack channel that your bot is in
